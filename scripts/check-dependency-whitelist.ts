/**
 * check-dependency-whitelist.ts
 *
 * The cross-repository boundary gate for the nerima-games Minecraft rebuild.
 * This file is the TEMPLATE for all 16 repositories: adapting it to a sibling
 * repository means editing exactly one constant, `REPOSITORY_POLICY`, which is
 * fenced off at the top of the file. Everything below that fence is generic and
 * should be copied byte-for-byte.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What it enforces
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * 1. HARD FAILURE. Any violation exits non-zero. This is the deliberate
 *    difference from the reference implementation's `check-package-dag.ts`,
 *    which printed warnings and always exited 0 — a gate that cannot fail is
 *    documentation, not a gate.
 *
 * 2. NO CYCLES. The reference legalised six cycles through an allowlist of
 *    "co-evolution pairs". There is no such allowlist here: any cycle in the
 *    declared dependency graph is a configuration error and fails the build.
 *
 * 3. NO TRANSITIVE CLOSURE. A dependency is a licence to import that package
 *    and nothing else. If this repository depends on `mc-sim`, and `mc-sim`
 *    depends on `mc-physics`, this repository still may NOT import
 *    `mc-physics`. Reaching through a dependency is how a 16-repository split
 *    quietly turns back into a monolith.
 *
 * 4. KERNEL IS UNIVERSAL. `@nerima-games/mc-kernel` is the shared vocabulary
 *    and is importable from every repository without appearing in any
 *    allowlist. It must still be declared in package.json — universal
 *    importability is a policy exemption, not a packaging exemption.
 *
 * 5. DECLARED == IMPORTED. Every imported org package must appear in
 *    package.json (`dependencies` for shipped code, `dependencies` or
 *    `devDependencies` for tests and tooling). Carried over from the
 *    reference's `check-ddd-boundaries.ts`.
 *
 * 6. mc-playground-kit IS DEV-ONLY. It must never appear in `dependencies` and
 *    must never be imported from shipped source. A runtime dependency on it
 *    would delete input handling from the shipped game.
 *
 * 7. NO RAW CLOCK READS. `Date.now()`, `new Date()` and `performance.now()` are
 *    banned; time comes from the injected clock Port. This lives here rather
 *    than in oxlint.json because oxlint 0.12 implements neither
 *    `no-restricted-syntax` nor `no-restricted-properties`, and its
 *    `no-restricted-globals` is listed but not implemented. Verified
 *    empirically against oxlint 0.12.0. Move the ban to oxlint.json when
 *    oxlint gains one of those rules.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Known limits
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * - Import extraction is regex-based over a comment/string/regex-literal mask,
 *   not a parse. It is deliberately lightweight so that it has no dependencies
 *   of its own. It does not understand `export =`, and a `/` that the mask
 *   heuristic misreads as starting a regex literal blanks code until the next
 *   `/`. Both failure modes are false NEGATIVES (a missed violation), never
 *   false positives, so the gate never blocks correct code.
 * - Cycle detection runs over `REPOSITORY_POLICY.dependencyGraph`. This copy
 *   carries the COMPLETE 16-repository roster, so every cycle in the declared
 *   organisation graph is visible from here. The rows for other repositories
 *   are mirrored by hand, so the roster is only as accurate as the last time
 *   somebody updated it; it should eventually be published from mc-dev-meta and
 *   consumed rather than copied.

/**
 * `thisPackage`
 *   The npm name of the repository this script lives in.
 *
 * `dependencyGraph`
 *   Direct dependency edges, keyed by package name. The row for `thisPackage`
 *   is authoritative and is what the import check enforces. Rows for other
 *   packages are mirrored from their own repositories and exist so that cycle
 *   detection has something to work with; keeping them in sync is a manual
 *   chore today, and the organisation-wide graph should eventually be published
 *   from a single meta-repository and consumed here.
 *
 *   Do NOT list `@nerima-games/mc-kernel` in any row: it is universally
 *   importable and is handled by rule 4 above.
 *
 * `aliases`
 *   Historical or in-flight package names mapped to their canonical name, so a
 *   rename can land in one repository at a time without breaking the gate.
 *   Same role as the reference's `targetPackageAliases`.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * mx-ui is an EXPERIENCE MODULE (plan.md §2.2, §3.13): a verb, not a noun. It
 * owns every DOM surface — HUD, menus, inventory and crafting screens,
 * settings, achievements and statistics, captions, loading and save indicators
 * — and owns no game state: it renders projections of mc-sim's state and
 * dispatches intents back into mc-sim.
 *
 * Its parents are mc-sim and mc-audio (plus mc-kernel, which is universal).
 * mc-audio is here for exactly one reason: the caption event stream
 * (plan.md §3.6, §4.3), which mx-ui subscribes to so that a player who cannot
 * hear still sees what the game is saying.
 *
 * Two consequences worth spelling out:
 *
 *   1. NO TRANSITIVE CLOSURE. mc-sim depends on mc-worldgen; mx-ui does not.
 *      A world-selection screen listing saved worlds asks mc-sim, not
 *      mc-worldgen or mc-save. Importing either is reported as
 *      `transitive-import` with the path that explains it.
 *   2. NO EDGE TO ANOTHER EXPERIENCE MODULE. "Mining fills a hotbar slot" is
 *      not an mx-gameplay -> mx-ui edge: mx-gameplay writes to mc-sim's
 *      InventoryService, and mx-ui reads that service. mx-ui therefore has no
 *      compile-time knowledge that mining exists.
 *
 * mx-ui needs NO mc-playground-kit (plan.md §3.13: it boots from the DOM
 * alone), so its previews are plain dev entry points with mocked state. Rule 6
 * still applies here, because the rule is org-wide rather than per-repository.
