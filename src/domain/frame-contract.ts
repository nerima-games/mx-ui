/**
 * The frame / module composition contract (plan.md §4.1), restated locally.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AND WHEN IT DIES
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * These declarations belong to `@nerima-games/mc-kernel` (`domain/frame.ts`,
 * `domain/identifiers.ts`, `domain/quantities.ts`). This repository does not
 * import them, because the roll-out is bottom-up publish-then-pin: nothing is on
 * GitHub Packages yet, so there is no version of kernel to depend on. Declaring
 * a dependency we cannot install would leave a skeleton that does not build.
 *
 * So the contract is restated here, deliberately character-identical to kernel's
 * copy in the parts that matter (`StageRegistration`, the brands' predicates and
 * error messages), and this file is DELETED the moment mc-kernel is published:
 *
 *     import type { StageRegistration } from '@nerima-games/mc-kernel'
 *
 * The one intentional divergence is `FrameServices`; see its note below.
 *
 * Nothing else in this repository may restate a kernel type. A second local copy
 * of, say, `BlockType` would be a fork of the vocabulary rather than a stand-in
 * for it, and the whole point of kernel (plan.md §3.1) is that the vocabulary has
 * exactly one home.

 * identifier as kernel's — two tags that look identical and are not, which is a
 * far worse failure than a narrower type.
 *
 * `never` is forward-compatible in the direction that matters: an
 * `Effect<void, never, never>` is assignable wherever `Effect<void, never,
 * ClockPort>` is wanted, so every stage written against this file keeps
 * typechecking when the alias is replaced by the kernel import. Widening
 * `FrameServices` is a breaking change for whoever BUILDS the runtime, never for

/**
 * A repository's contribution to a running game.
 *
 * `ROut`      — services this module provides.
 * `E`         — errors that can occur while *building* those services.
 * `RIn`       — services this module needs to be given in order to build.
 * `RRegister` — services this module needs in order to REGISTER its stages.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `frameStages` is an Effect, and this repository is part of why
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * kernel declared it `ReadonlyArray<StageRegistration>` — a VALUE — until the
 * vertical-slice spike. A value has no context, so a module had no moment at
 * which it could acquire a service in order to BUILD a stage, and the only
 * remaining channel was `run` — which forced every service any stage touched
 * into `FrameServices`, and that in turn forced kernel to name mc-sim's and
 * mc-render's services. The tier model (plan.md §2.2) forbids that outright.
 *
 * `stages/registration.ts` in this repository had already run into it: it
 * exported an `Effect.Effect<ReadonlyArray<StageRegistration>>` with a comment
 * saying it "is NOT yet a `GameModule`" because the service set could not be
 * named. It was the right shape all along, and the contract has caught up.
 *
 * `RRegister` is separate from `RIn` because the two are genuinely different
 * sets — mc-render acquires `InputService` to register its input stage, and
 * `InputService` is a service mc-render PROVIDES rather than one it needs to be
 * given. It defaults to `never` so the common module still reads as three
 * parameters, which is exactly how this repository writes its own.
 *
 * The error channel of `frameStages` stays `never`, unlike the Layer's: a
 * module that can fail to come up says so in `E`, where a host already has to
 * handle it.
